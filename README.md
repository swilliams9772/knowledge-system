## Introduction

The **Knowledge Synthesis Agent (KSA)** is an AI system designed to synthesize and expand human knowledge by leveraging multi-modal reasoning, hierarchical memory structures, and adaptive planning strategies. Built with cutting-edge AI architectures and open-source tools, KSA is capable of processing and understanding information across various data modalities.

## Key Features

### üß† Multi-Modal Reasoning

- **Text, Image, and Graph Processing**: Capable of understanding and processing information from text, images, and graphs.
- **Neural Fusion**: Integrates different data modalities using neural network-based fusion techniques.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Achieves deep contextual understanding by correlating information across modalities.
- **Reflective Reasoning**: Implements reflective reasoning with confidence scoring to evaluate outputs.
- **Tool-Augmented Analysis**: Extends reasoning capabilities through integration with external tools.

### üóÇÔ∏è Hierarchical Memory System

- **Sensory Memory**: Short-term storage with 30-second retention for immediate data.
- **Working Memory**: Active processing storage with a 7-item capacity for current tasks.
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores experience-based data for long-term retrieval.
- **Semantic Memory**: Maintains a knowledge graph for structured information.
- **Short-Term Memory**: Keeps track of recent interactions to inform ongoing processes.

### üß© Advanced Planning Strategies

- **Hierarchical Task Networks**: Decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improves plans through iteration.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Utilizes probabilistic methods for decision-making.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Solves problems within specified constraints.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Supports collaborative planning among multiple agents.

### üåê Knowledge Graph

- **Flexible Backend Support**: Compatible with NetworkX and RDFLib for graph management.
- **Neural Embeddings**: Employs neural embeddings for efficient similarity search.
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Organizes concepts hierarchically for better comprehension.
- **Semantic Querying**: Allows for advanced querying capabilities over the knowledge base.

### üîå External Tool Integration

- **Privacy-Focused Search**: Integrates with SearxNG for anonymous web searches.
- **Computational Knowledge**: Accesses Wolfram Alpha for computational queries.
- **Knowledge Bases**: Interfaces with Wikipedia and Wikidata for factual information.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Utilizes Pandas and NumPy for data processing and analysis.

## Architecture

### System Components

The KSA architecture consists of interconnected modules that facilitate multi-modal data processing, hierarchical memory management, and advanced planning:

- **Multi-Modal Reasoner**: Processes and fuses data from text, images, and graphs.
- **Hierarchical Memory**: Manages different memory types for efficient information retrieval.
- **Experience-Augmented Planner**: Generates and refines plans using memory and reasoning outputs.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Acts as the semantic backbone, connecting concepts and data.
- **External Interfaces**: Bridges to external tools and APIs for extended capabilities.

## Installation

To install the Knowledge Synthesis Agent, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ksa.git
   ```
2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd ksa
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using KSA by running the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to initialize and use the Knowledge Synthesis Agent in your project:

```python
from ksa import KnowledgeSynthesisAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = KnowledgeSynthesisAgent()

# Process multi-modal data
agent.process_data(text="Sample text", image="path/to/image.png")

# Generate a plan
plan = agent.create_plan(goal="Expand knowledge on climate change")

# Execute the plan
agent.execute_plan(plan)
```

## Configuration

You can configure KSA by modifying the `config.yaml` file to suit your project's needs, including setting API keys, adjusting memory capacities, and selecting planning strategies.

## Examples

Please refer to the [examples](examples/) directory for detailed use cases and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the capabilities of KSA.
